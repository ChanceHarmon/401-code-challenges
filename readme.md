# Reverse an Array
Reverse an array using non conventional tools

## Challenge
given an array of any type or length, reverse the array in place

## Approach & Efficiency
Intially I thought of moving each index zero to the end of an array, decreaseing the length moved by one each time the loop ran. Solution was to swap [i] @ 0 with Arr.length -1, [i] @ 1 to Arr.length and so on. Eventually when you get to half way through the array you can devide by two, because logically the rest of the array is already sorted. Thanks for the help today!
